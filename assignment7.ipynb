    "# 1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The feature responsible for generating Regex objects in Python is called the \"re\" module. The \"re\" module provides support for regular expressions, including functions and methods to compile, match, search, and manipulate strings using regular expressions."

    "# 2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Raw strings (r'...') are often used in regular expressions to avoid unwanted escaping of special characters. Regular expressions often contain special characters with special meanings, such as backslashes (\\), which are used to escape other characters or introduce special sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using raw strings, backslashes and other special characters are treated literally, without any special interpretation. This is useful when working with regular expressions because it allows us to write the pattern without having to escape the backslashes explicitly."
