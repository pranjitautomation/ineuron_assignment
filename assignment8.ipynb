    "# 1. Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: No, the Python Standard Library is not included with PyInputPlus. PyInputPlus is a third-party library that provides additional functionality for taking user input in Python, such as input validation, input retry, and timeout handling. "

    "\n",
    "Ans: PyInputPlus is commonly imported with the alias pypi using import pyinputplus as pypi to make it easier to type when calling its functions in the code. It also helps to avoid naming conflicts with other modules or functions that might have the same name as PyInputPlus functions."
